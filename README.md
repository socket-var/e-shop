# e-shop: An e-commerce site with real data

This is a work-in-progress project that has been created to learn how to efficiently build an end-to-end e-commerce application using the MERN stack.

Some of the unique features of this project are:
- It uses real data from flipkart - checkout the data folder in the root of the repository.
- The concept of recommender systems would be integrated in the future.
